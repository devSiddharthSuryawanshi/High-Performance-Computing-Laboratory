Qn.7 
Write a Parallel C program where the iterations of a loop should be scheduled 
statically across the team of threads. A thread should perform CHUNK iterations 
at a time before being scheduled for the next CHUNK of work. 
 
Code :-  
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <omp.h> 
int main() { 
    int N = 20;         // total iterations 
    int CHUNK = 3;      // chunk size 
    omp_set_num_threads(4);  // set 4 threads 
    printf("Scheduling loop statically with CHUNK = %d\n", CHUNK); 
    #pragma omp parallel 
    { 
        int tid = omp_get_thread_num(); 
        // Parallel for with static schedule and chunk size 
        #pragma omp for schedule(static, CHUNK) 
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
            printf("Thread %d is processing iteration %d\n", tid, i); 
        } 
    } 
    return 0; 
}
